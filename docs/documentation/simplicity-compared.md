Simplicity was designed from the ground up to address the limitations of existing blockchain scripting languages while maintaining the security guarantees that make Bitcoin reliable.


| | **Bitcoin Script** | **Miniscript** | **Solidity** | **Simplicity** | **Comments** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Primary purpose** | Minimal spend conditions for Bitcoin UTXOs | Safer, structured way to write Bitcoin Script policies | General-purpose smart contracts on Ethereum-like blockchains | Formally verifiable contracts in Bitcoin-like settings | |
| **Expressiveness** | Limited by design | More composable than Bitcoin script | Very high | High within strict rules | More features enable richer apps but can introduce more ways to make mistakes. |
| **Execution model** | Stack-based, no global state | Policy → Script, tree-structured, Stack-based. | Runs on EVM with global state | Combinator-based, no loops/state | Affects fees, speed, and how contracts interact. Simpler execution models are easier to reason about and audit. |
| **Turing-completeness** | No | No | Yes | No | Non–Turing-complete means predictability: no endless loops and easier to know scripts finish quickly. Gas is less relevant; execution time is bounded. |
| **Typical use cases** | Payments, multisig, timelocks | Advanced wallet policies, thresholds with fallbacks | DeFi, tokens, DAOs, dApps | High-assurance financial logic on Liquid | Guides what each is good for so solutions aren't overbuilt or underpowered. |
| **Safety approach** | Minimal opcodes, deterministic | Constrained grammar + static checks | Security via patterns, audits, tooling | Designed for formal proofs and determinism | Tells how each reduces bugs and protects funds. Simpler rules = fewer surprises. |
| **State model** | UTXO (local) | UTXO (via Script) | Account/global state | UTXO-style | Local (UTXO) limits blast radius; global state enables composability but can spread risk. |
| **Formal verification** | Limited | Better static analysis | Possible but complex | Core feature | Strong guarantees lower the chance of catastrophic bugs and costly exploits. |
| **Performance/resource bounds** | Bounded by consensus | Bounded by consensus | Gas-limited execution | Strict bounds | Predictable costs and low DoS risk make fees and UX more stable. |
| **Interoperability** | Bitcoin-native | Bitcoin-native | EVM-wide standards | Liquid ecosystem | Affects integrations and network effects for adoption. |
