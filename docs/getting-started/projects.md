!!! tip
    For beginners and quick experimentation, start with the [WebIDE](https://ide.simplicity-lang.org). It runs in your browser—no installation.  
    For contract development, move to [SimplicityHL](https://github.com/BlockstreamResearch/SimplicityHL), the high‑level Rust-like language that compiles to core Simplicity.
