## Quick Start Recommendations

For **beginners and experimentation**, we recommend starting with the [**WebIDE**](https://github.com/BlockstreamResearch/simplicity-webide) - it runs directly in your browser and requires no setup.

For **script development**, start with [SimplicityHL](https://github.com/BlockstreamResearch/SimplicityHL) - the Rust-like high-level language that compiles down to core Simplicity.

## Available Tools & Implementations


| Language/Tool | Purpose |
|---------------|---------|
| :material-lambda: [**Simplicity Haskell Implementation**](https://github.com/BlockstreamResearch/simplicity/tree/master/Haskell) | The **reference implementation** and also generates code for Rust and C implementations |
| :material-microscope: [**Coq (Rocq)**](https://github.com/BlockstreamResearch/simplicity/tree/master/Coq) | The **formal implementation** |
| :material-flash: [**C**](https://github.com/BlockstreamResearch/simplicity/tree/master/C) | The **consensus implementation** |
| :simple-rust: [**Rust Simplicity**](https://github.com/BlockstreamResearch/rust-simplicity) | The **practical implementation** in the form of a Rust library. |
| :simple-rust: [**SimplicityHL**](https://github.com/BlockstreamResearch/SimplicityHL) | Rust-like high-level language that compiles down to Simplicity. Recommended starting point |
| :material-web: [**WebIDE**](https://github.com/BlockstreamResearch/simplicity-webide) | A good way to test out Simplicity scripts directly in your browser. |
| :material-tools: [**Command line tool**](https://github.com/BlockstreamResearch/hal-simplicity) | Hal-Simplicity is a command line tool (written in Rust) based on [`hal`](https://github.com/stevenroose/hal) by Stephen Roose |
| :material-lock: [**ZKP**](https://github.com/starkware-bitcoin/stark-symphony) | A zero knowledge prover written in SimplicityHL |

**Next Steps**: Try out the [WebIDE](https://github.com/BlockstreamResearch/simplicity-webide) to get a feel for Simplicity, then dive into [SimplicityHL](https://github.com/BlockstreamResearch/SimplicityHL) for your first real projects.
