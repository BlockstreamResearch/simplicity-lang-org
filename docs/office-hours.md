# Office Hours

Starting in November 2025, you can now join a weekly Office Hours call
to talk about what you're working on with Simplicity or to ask questions.

This call is hosted by Blockstream staff involved in developing and documenting Simplicity and SimplicityHL. **You can use this call to ask all of your questions at any technical level. You're also welcome to use it to pass along feature requests and feedback about how Simplicity and SimplicityHL are working for your applications and use cases.**

This call will be held on Tuesdays at 8:00 <a
href="https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zone/usa/san-francisco">PST
(UTC-8)</a> and will typically last one hour. We may occasionally skip
it due to U.S. holidays or other events. These Office Hours calls are
routinely recorded and published (see below). If you would prefer a
non-recorded conversation, please contact us for alternative arrangements.
