## The Goal

Ship clear, accurate docs that help real users build with **Simplicity**. If your change makes the docs easier to find, understand, or trust, you’re in the right place.

## What You Can Contribute

* New guides, tutorials, and examples
* Reference improvements
* Typos, broken links, grammar fixes
* Diagrams and architecture overviews
* Clarifications to confusing sections
* “Gotchas” and troubleshooting notes

If you’re unsure it belongs here, it probably does. Submit the PR.

## Content Standards

**Write for doers.**

* **Be direct.** Short sentences. Active voice. No fluff.
* **Front‑load the “how”.** Show a working snippet before deep theory.
* **One idea per section.** If your page does too much, split it.
* **Name things consistently.** Match code, error messages, and UI.
* **Show, don’t tell.** Prefer runnable examples to paragraphs.
* **Call out risk.** Use “⚠️” notes for foot‑guns and security pitfalls.
* **Cite sources** for claims and specs where useful.

### Style

* English (US), Markdown only.
* Headings: `# H1`, `## H2`, `### H3` (don’t skip levels).
* Code fences with language tags: \`\`\`rust, \`\`\`bash, \`\`\`json, etc.
* File/command names as `code` inline.
* Use lists, tables, and callouts for scan‑ability.

### Examples

* Keep examples **minimal** and **correct**.
* Prefer full, copy‑pasteable blocks over fragments.
* If an example needs setup, include it (or link to it).

### Diagrams

* Prefer [Mermaid](https://github.blog/developer-skills/github/include-diagrams-markdown-files-mermaid/) diagrams/flowcharts.

**Thanks for making the Simplicity docs better.**
