## Simplicity Docs

Simplicity is a minimal, deterministic, functional language built for Bitcoinâ€™s trust model. It offers elegance over complexity, enabling powerful smart contracts without relying on a growing list of ad hoc opcodes.

The site is built on [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)
